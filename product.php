            <td colspan="2"><p>"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is a 1998 movie directed by Terry Gilliam, based on the novel of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson. The movie follows the adventures of journalist Raoul Duke, played by Johnny Depp, and his attorney Dr. Gonzo, played by Benicio Del Toro, as they travel to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race and engage in a drug-fueled, surrealistic rampage.
              The movie is a dark comedy that satirizes the counterculture of the 1960s and the excesses of the American dream. The characters of Duke and Gonzo represent two extremes of the era: Duke, a disillusioned journalist who struggles to make sense of the chaos around him, and Gonzo, a reckless and anarchic figure who embodies the spirit of rebellion.              
              As the movie progresses, Duke and Gonzo descend into a psychedelic nightmare, fueled by a variety of drugs and fueled by their own paranoia and delusions. They encounter a variety of bizarre characters and engage in increasingly absurd and dangerous activities, including a confrontation with a hotel clerk, a drug-fueled road trip, and an encounter with a group of police officers.
