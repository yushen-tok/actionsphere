# ActionSphere Cinemas - Ticket Booking System
SWE20001 - ActionSphere Cinemas


ActionSphere Cinemas is a startup movie theatre that specializes in providing patrons the opportunity to reserve screenings of various movie genres, with a primary focus on action films. Additionally, the cinema offers distinct themed spaces available for renting, complete with action-oriented decorations, games, and events, creating an immersive experience for visitors. 

They are looking to have a web-based application for their customers to get to know their business operations and what they have to offer and make reservations. Simultaneously, the backend system is being designed to empower the staff in efficiently overseeing and managing these bookings. 

Therefore, we bring this development on github for easy collaboration between the development team and audit for changes made to the code and for file redundancies.
